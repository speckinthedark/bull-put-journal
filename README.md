# TradeJournal: A Bull Put Spread Tracker

TradeJournal is a modern, intuitive web application designed to help options traders meticulously track their bull put spread trades. It enforces a disciplined trading process through built-in checklists and provides clear performance analytics to help you understand and improve your trading strategy.

This application is built to be run locally, using Firebase's Firestore as a secure backend to store all your trade data persistently. The codebase has been completely refactored following React best practices for maintainability and scalability.

## Key Features

* **Performance Overview:** A comprehensive dashboard that visualizes your trading performance. View your total P/L, win rate, and a breakdown of winning vs. losing trades, all filterable by month.
* **Disciplined Trade Entry:** A dedicated form for entering new trades that requires you to complete mandatory Macro/Underlying and Entry Rule checklists before a trade can be logged. This enforces your trading plan on every setup.
* **Ongoing Trade Tracking:** See all your open positions at a glance with visual DTE (Days to Expiration) circular progress indicators. The app automatically highlights trades entering the critical "gamma risk" window (21 DTE or less).
* **Enhanced Exit Management:** Modern modal-based interface for closing out trades with intelligent P/L sign handling and exit confirmations directly from trade cards.
* **Real-time Price Integration:** Alpha Vantage API integration for enhanced market data (with 25 requests/day limit).
* **Advanced Analytics:** Strike price tracking in closed trades table and DTE-based sorting for ongoing trades.
* **Template System:** Built-in trade template service for quick trade setup based on common strategies.
* **Persistent Data:** All trade data is securely stored in your personal Firebase Firestore database, ensuring your journal is always up-to-date every time you open the app.

### 2. Set Up Firebase

You need a free Firebase project to act as your backend.

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  From the project dashboard, create a **Firestore Database**. Start it in **Production mode**.
3.  In the **Authentication** section, go to the "Sign-in method" tab and **enable** the **Anonymous** provider.
4.  Go to your **Project settings** (gear icon) and in the "Your apps" section, create a new **Web app** (`</>`).
5.  Copy the `firebaseConfig` object that is generated. You will need this in a moment.

### 3. Clone and Install

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd bull-put-journal
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses specific versions of Tailwind CSS and its dependencies to ensure compatibility.
    ```bash
    npm install recharts lucide-react firebase tailwindcss@^3.4.0 postcss@^8.4.0 autoprefixer@^10.4.0
    ```

### 4. Configure Environment

1.  In the `src/` directory, create a new file named `firebase.js`.
2.  Paste the following code into `firebase.js`, replacing the placeholder with the `firebaseConfig` object you copied from your Firebase project:

    ```javascript
    import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
    import { getAuth, signInAnonymously, onAuthStateChanged, signInWithCustomToken } from 'firebase/auth';
    import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

    // PASTE YOUR FIREBASE CONFIG OBJECT HERE
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "AIza...",
      authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "your-project-id",
      storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "...",
      appId: "..."
    };

    // Initialize Firebase
    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    const auth = getAuth(app);
    const db = getFirestore(app);
    const appId = firebaseConfig.appId;

    export { db, auth, appId, signInAnonymously, onAuthStateChanged, signInWithCustomToken };
    ```

3.  **Configure Alpha Vantage API** (for enhanced market data features):
    - Get a free API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)
    - The API key is already integrated in the refactored codebase within the PriceService class
    - Note: Free tier provides 25 requests per day, which is sufficient for typical usage patterns
    - This enables real-time price display and enhanced trade analysis features

### 5. Run the Application

You're all set! Start the local development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port). 

### 6. Development Notes

- **Hot Reload**: Changes to the code will automatically refresh the browser
- **Component Development**: New UI components should be added to `src/components/ui/`
- **Business Logic**: Add utility functions to `src/utils/` for reusability
- **Data Management**: Extend the custom hooks in `src/hooks/` for new data operations
